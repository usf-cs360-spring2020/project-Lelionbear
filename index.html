          <h4>Project Narrative</h4>
          <p>
          San Francisco is a city known for its culture and iconic landmarks. This has
          been a central point of attention for film makers as they take shots of
          the city for an upcomming movie. By using the "Film Locations in San Francisco"
          dataset, I will be exploring the number of locations movie directors choose
          to film at. I can additionally explore the most shot at location
          in the city followed by the most popular places to film at in the 21st century.
