          <h2 class="title">PROJECT NARRATIVE</h2>
          <p>
          San Francisco is a city known for its culture and iconic landmarks. This has
          been a central point of attention for film makers as they film shots of
          the city for an upcomming movie. By using the "Film Locations in San Francisco"
          dataset in combination with The Movie Database API, I will be exploring
          the number of movies within each genre after the year 2000.
          I will additionally explore the voted averages for each movie along with
          a visualization involving the profit (revenue - budget = profit) made for the movie.
          </p>
