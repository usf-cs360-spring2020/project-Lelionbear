          Encoding
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          The sunburst visualization is the main visualization that contians all
          of the collected movie data. The center represents the city of San Francisco
          while the first ring (from inside to outside) represents the genre of
          movies filmed in San Francisco. The second ring represents the movie's
          release date visually grouped by decade, the years focused are from 1950 and upwards.
          <br><br>
          The circlepacking visualization is derived from the sunburst data specifically
          from the genre selected when clicked. The data is broken down into the
          decade and then by the movie's release year. The sizes of the innermost
          purple circles are represented by the revenue gained for that movie.
          With a hover interactivity, the title and revenue is displayed for each movie.
          <br><br>
          The dentree visualization is derived from the sunburst's segmented decade, the second ring.
          This tree is broken down by the release year followed by the movies in that year.
          The color gradient of the movie circles represents the average voted rating
          for that movie. With the hover interactivity, the title and voted average
          for the movie can be shown.
          These votes are based on the obtained information from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database (TMDB)</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" align="center">
          Interactivity
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          Start off with the sunburst visualization, this is the main visual that
          contains all the collected movie information. When an arc is clicked,
          the number of movies within that arc is displayed. Depending on what arc
          is clicked a second visualization is generated. By clicking the genre
          arc a circlepacking is formed while clicking on the decade forms a dentree.
          To reset the original sunburst information just click the center whitespace.
          <br><br>
          Both circlepacking and dentree visualizations only do a mouseover interactivity.
          On the circlepacking the title of the movie followed by the revenue gained is shown.
          On the dentree the title of the movie followed by the vote average is shown.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" align="center">
          Findings
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          A major finding from the visualizations is that a total of 109 movies fall under
          the "Drama" genre, making it the most popular filming cannon in San Francisco.
          Through the use of the circlepacking visualization, we can also display that
          movie information became more interesting to the general public as the
          database is filled with incomplete data that is just zeroed out, throwing off
          the visualization for this narritive. However, with movie revenues after the year 2000,
          we can see that the 2010 decade has a higher revenue compared to the 2000 decade.
          Additoanally, the votes for movies obtained from the database can be seen to
          average out within a narrow range of ratings. Additional data would be needed
          to create an accurate visual for movie revenue and average movie votes.
