          Encoding
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          Explain to general users how your data is encoded and how to interpret your visualization(s).
          The sunburst visualization is the main visualization that contians all
          of the collected movie data. The center represents the city of San Francisco
          while the first ring (from inside to outside) represents the genre of
          movies filmed in San Francisco. The second ring represents the movie's
          release date within a 5 year section, the years focused are from 2000 and upwards.
          <br><br>
          The circlepacking visualization is derived from the sunburst data specifically
          from the genre selected when clicked. The data is broken down into the
          segmented year and then by the movie's release year. The sizes of the
          innermost circles are represented by the revenue gained for that movie.
          The hover interactivity displays this as the mouse is moved over each individual circle.
          <br><br>
          The dentree visualization is derived from the sunburst's segmented year, the second ring.
          This tree is broken down by the release year followed by the movies in that year.
          The hover interactivity displays the voted average for the movie based on the
          obtained information from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie Database (TMDB)</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" align="center">
          Interactivity
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          Start off with the sunburst visualization, this is the main display that
          contains all the collected movie information. When the mouse hovers over
          an arc, the number of movies within that arc is displayed. When an arc
          is clicked, a second visualization is displayed. To unselect an arc simply
          click the same arc.
          <br><br>
          Both circlepacking and dentree visualizations only do a mouseover interactivity.
          On the circlepacking the title of the movie followed by the revenue gained is shown.
          On the dentree the title of the movie followed by the vote average is shown.
        </p>

        <h2 class="title" align="center">
          Findings
        </h2>
        <p align="center">
          A major finding from the visualizations is that a total of 41 movies fall under
          the "Drama" genre, making it the most popular filming cannon in San Francisco.
          Through the use of the circlepacking visualization, we can also display that
          movies released after 2010 have a higher revenue than movies before 2010.
          Additoanally, the average vote for movies can be seen to fluctuate leading
          to an additoanl need of input data for a better accuracy of movie votes.
